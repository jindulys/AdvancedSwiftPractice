// What if a struct has a class property, how the copy work. In my mind, the new struct's property will have the same reference value to some object.

// Copy on write. When we define our own struct and pass it around. the trick is define a custom accessor for the property we want to manually copy.

// isUniquelyReferencedNonObjC could detect whether a pointer is uniquely referenced. but it only works with Swift objects. To work around, we create a simple wrapper type, Box.

final class Box<T> {
    var unbox: T
    init(_ value: T) { unbox = value }
}


// Transferring money between bank accounts


// Method 1: classes 

// disadvantage: Could not work in multithread environment. become interleaved with another thread.
